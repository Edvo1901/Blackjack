# Description: Assignment 2 (part 2) â€“ You are required to write a Python program that will manage player information. The program will allow players to
# play blackjack (dice version) against the computer and will maintain information on players. Player information will be
# stored in a text file that will be read in when the program commences. Once the initial player information has been
# read in from the file, the program should allow the user to interactively query and manipulate the player information as
# well as play blackjack against the computer. Please ensure that you read sections titled 'Part II specification' below for
# further details.
# This is my own work as defined by the University's
# Academic Misconduct policy.
